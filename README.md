### Notes:
* As an illustrative example, folder `NEWS(12GB)` denotes the checkpoints from pretraining RoBERTa-base on downsampled RealNews, see more details in the paper.
* Within folders like, `NEWS(12GB)`, you will see `roberta_bz256_savesteps` or `roberta_bz256_saveepochs` or both; those names denote how the checkpoints (within those folder) are saved during prertaining **by epoch or step**. The name of a checkpoint folder is `checkpoint-xx`
